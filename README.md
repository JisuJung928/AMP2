# AMP2
AMP2 (Automated <i>Ab initio</i> Modeling of Materials Property Package) is automation code for VASP calculation. Only if the structure files (*.cif, POSCAR) are prepared, you can directly get the precise simulation result with fully-automated process.

Now the band calculation (band gap, band structure), dielectric constant, effective mass, density of states calculation codes are provided.
